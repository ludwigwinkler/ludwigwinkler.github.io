### Kleptocracy in Lebanon

#### A bit of context which is a wild ride in itself

The modern story of the Lebanon starts with a French Monsieur Francois Georges-Picot, a British Gentleman Mark Sykes and the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed V.
As members of the Triple Entente between France, England and Russia, the British and French had plans for the Middle East which they wanted to wrest from the control of the Ottoman Empire which had allied itself with the German Empire.
Even before the war was over, the two diplomats Picot and Sykes duked it out and divided the central Middle East into spheres of influence between France and Britain.

The British would control a strip of land ranging from modern Israel/Palestine through Jordan to central and southern Iraq, whereas France would control modern day Lebanon, Syria and northern Iraq.
European powers had a specific infatuation with protecting Christians outside of Europe.
The Russians had gone to war with the Ottoman empire as they wanted to style themselves as the protectors of Christians in the Ottoman Empire and Caucasus.
Similarly, the French wanted to see themselves as protectors of the significant Christian population living in the area around Mount Lebanon and in the Levant.
Important for the later story, the region was characterized by multi-ethnic and multi-religious cohabitation, with Maronite Christians, Druze, Shia and Sunni with their subdominations Alawites and Alevis also hanging around in the same region.
Maronite Christians are an Eastern Catholics while Druze are an eclectic mixture of religions and believes.
Shia and Sunni are similar to Protestants and Catholics in Christianity which split over an succession issue with the Shia's favouring Ali, a direct descendant of the prophet Muhammed, while the Sunni favoured the unrelated Abu Bakr.

The British and French had indirectly already come to blows during a Maronite-Druze civil war in the Levant.
While the French supported the Maronites, the British wanted to protect their interests and supported the Druze.
If you're confused why I'm recounting Lebanon's history on a napkin, the multi-confessional composition of Lebanon will play an important role later on.

With the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the French became the rulers of Lebanon under the mandate of the League of Nations.
The French would stay in Lebanon until shortly after World War 2 and the country prospered.
It was soon regarded as the Switzerland of the Middle East with a well functioning administration, a multi-lingual population and strong banking secrecy.
So literally like Switzerland, but a bit sunnier.

Things went well for quite some time but the ill-configured setup of the Lebanon was already discernible.
It should be noted that especially the Maronites and the Druze were ethno-religious groups which offered two ways of separating themselves from other people, through kinship and through religion.
This was unofficially encoded in the National Pact of 1943 which assigned seats and thus political power in the parliament on a 6-to-5 proportionality based on a 1932 census of the population.
Another implementation to get to grips with the multi-ethno-religious composition of the population was to predetermine the representative posts in the government according to the confession: the president was always a Maronite Christian, the speaker of the parliament a Shia and the prime minister a Sunni.
While it did not seem like the best way to govern a country, economically the strong banking sector was especially well positioned to benefit from the fresh petro money coming out of the oil rich middle eastern countries and thus the Lebanon prospered tremendously in the 1960.

But right at its door step a convoluted situation had developed in the British part of the Sykes-Picot agreement.
After the establishment of the Israeli state in 1948 and the Suez War of 1956, which was also instigated by the Brits and the French over the nationalization of the Suez canal, the Israelis invaded the Sinai peninsula to open the strait of Tiran to Israeli naval vessels.
In the relatively short period of six days, Israel managed to take over the Sinai peninsula again and conquer the Gaza strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
As a consequence, 300.000 Palestinains and 100.000 Syrians fled and/or were expelled from the newly occupied areas with many Palestinians fleeing to Jordan.
The suffering of the Palestinian population caused the Palestine Liberation Organization to become militarily active and soon it started accumulating large amounts of money and weapons with its headquarter established in Jordans capital Amman.

The PLO as the dominant recipient of political, financial and military support and prime proxy insurgency against Israel quickly became a state within the state of Jordan.
Soon, the idea was promulgated that the PLO should overthrow the Jordan Hashemite monarchy.
Obviously the Jordanian kingdom would have none of that and the short lived Jordanian civil war broke out, in which the PLO was ultimately defeated by the Jordanian armed forces in September 1970 and allowed to leave for Lebanon.

The fighting in September of 1970 lead to the formation of a terrorist splinter faction which called itself 'Black September' and which sought retribution for the expulsion from Jordan.
But they soon focused on attacking Israel again and became infamous through the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 olympic games in Munich.
Unfortunately, when the PLO arrived in Lebanon the Jordanian story was repeated again as the PLO again started to behave like a semi-autonomous state within a state.
Maybe they did inspire the Hezbollah 20 years later who are behaving just the same ... but who knows.

The Lebanese state of political affairs had already been fragile necessatitating the afore-mentioned power sharing agreements.
The sudden arrival of the PLO as the most powerful military force in Lebanon quickly pitted them against the ethno-religious militias as power had always remained with the different political factions and not with a centralized state.
Tensions started to flare up especially with the Maronite Christian Phalange militia which ultimately led to the start of the Lebanese civil war from 1975 to 1990.

While the civil war was raging, a Lebanese business man by the name of Rafic Hariri made his first millions doing construction work in Saudi-Arabia.
He quickly gained the trust of the Saudi royal family and as a native Lebanese became embroiled in the factional power plays of the Lebanese civil war.
After 15 years of civil war, the fatigued factions were ready for a peace deal and Rafic Hariri was there to broker it in one of his hotels in Ta'if in Saudi Arabia.
It was appropriately called the Ta'if agreement.

Every fight should require a truth and reconciliation process in which the reasons and deeds of the each party are post-hoc worked through.
It is true that a civil war is not constant fighting and life continues once the demarcation lines, like the Green Line in Beirut separating Muslim east Beirut from Christian west Beirut, are established especially if the fighting goes on for 15 years without a clear winner.
But it is somewhat suspicious that the Ta'if accord was agreed upon by all the warring factions which had been fighting each other to the teeth.
And this is where the kleptocracy begins in earnest.

The Ta'if agreement changed the parliament to a 1-to-1 Muslim-Christian preassigned composition while strengthening the president.
Nevertheless, the previous agreements such as the predetermined religious affiliation of the speaker, president and prime minister was kept.
In essence, the militias partitioned the newly founded Lebanese state among themselves and created extreme rent-seeking mechanisms and patronage systems.
Ministries were distributed to the factional warlords and jobs were allotted along sectarian affiliation.

#### Neo-Liberal Post-War Order

This is are fairly run-of-the-mill corruption and has been replicated before and after the Ta'if agreement in many other countries.
But what made the Lebanese kleptocracy truly breath-taking is probably the largest Ponzi scheme and an entire national level in history that makes even Bernie Madoff look like an amateur.
It all boils down to the adage: Why rob a bank, if you can have one.

One has to remember that the Lebanese state was basically run by different confessional parties which had crafted the political system in such a way that their grip on power could hardly be challenged.
This became especially evident during the 2022 elections, when new parties had to be signed off by the ruling system which obviously never allowed new parties to push them out of power.

Rafic Hariri believed that the guarantor of growth for the Lebanese economy was the pegging of the Lebanese pound to the US dollar.
In a previous blog post I referred to the impossible trinity of economics: You can only choose two out of the following three: a stable exchange, a floating currency and sovereign economic policy.
The post civil war administration under Rafic Hariri chose to sacrifice economic sovereignty to keep the Lebanese pound at a stable exchange rate at around 1.500 LL to one dollar.
But since the national currency was floating, enough interest in the currency had to be generated to be able to keep the exchange rate.
Said differently, the central bank overseeing a currency pegged to the USD has to have considerable amounts of foreign exchange reserves to be able to exchange said currency at the fixed exchange rate at any time.

Lebanon had been living far beyond its means for a long time.
Trade balance had averaged from 2011 to 2019 between -20% and close to -30% while the fiscal balance went from -5% to -11% in the same time period.
The country was able to stave off the consequences on the exchange rate due to the large diaspora sending back remittances.
While Lebanon itself has around 6.8m citizens, the diaspora is estimated to be between 8m to 20m people which actively are in contact with their relatives.
This large diaspora sent back home over 7 billion USD, accounting up to 10% of GDP and providing a large steady influx of foreign currencies into the country.
But with the fall of oil prices in the 2010's, the remittances of the Lebanese diaspora from the oil-rich gulf states diminished, leading to the first signs of the liquidity crisis.

Additionally, the banking sector had a weird skew as 1% of the accounts accounted for 50% of overall banking deposits yielding an extreme concentration.
Even better, 0.1% of accounts held 20% of all deposits at the banks inside Lebanon.
This was worrisome in its own right but raised the question who these accounts were.
If roughly 7.000 accounts controlled 20% of all deposits, this yields considerable control over the banks.
The banking sector was also concentrated in another manner, namely that the secondary debt market was very limited with 70% of all bank deposits invested in public sector and government securities.
In essence, the banks and the government were cozy with each other up to a worrying degree.
One could in fact ask whether the banking sector and the government were run by the same interest groups.
This does hark back to the proverb earlier about robbing versus owning a bank, as to how corrupt and nepotistic the banking sector in Lebanon actually was.

#### The 'Swap'

The peg of the Lebanese pound became more strenuous to maintain with less and less hard currencies (Euros, Dollars, Yen, Francs etc) flowing into the country.
Remember that the official peg of ~1.500 LL to 1 USD forced the central bank to have sufficient foreign currencies on hand.
With the fissures in the foundation becoming apparent, the Banque du Liban went ape-shit neo-liberal at the extreme cost of the population to maintain the currency.
It started to serve the market instead of the people.

The Ministry of Finance issued Eurobonds (remember the unregulated British offshore market) in foreign currencies while the Banque du Liban issued equivalently valued treasury bills denominated in Lebanese pound.
Remember that the foundation and goal was the pegged Lebanese pound and as a consequence both the Eurobonds and the TB's were equivalent in value at least on paper.
In order to attract foreign currencies the Eurobonds offered a high interest rate up to 15% to guarantee that somebody would take the bonds off their hands.
The finance ministry and the central bank then swapped these bonds such that the central bank held the Eurobonds and the finance ministry the LL TB's.

Then the central bank turned around and sold the Eurobonds on the open market receiving sought-after hard currencies in return.
But the government was still on the hook for the Eurobonds while the nominal USD value had been transferred to the central bank which was now happy that it had hard currencies again.
Who was unhappy you might ask?
The population the taxes of which were used to pay the high interest rates.
But who was the beneficiary of the high return on investment of the Lebanese Eurobonds?
The commercial banks who provided USD from the diasporas remittances and received a significant interest of up to 15%.
This encouraged the commercial banks with the diasporas USD to offer higher interest rates as well which set of a Ponzi scheme pulling in more USD dollar deposits.

Additionally, the central bank printed fresh Lebanese pounds depositing them at very low interest rates at the commercial banks, while allowing the commercial banks to deposit high interest deposits at the central bank.
In total the commercial banks had net liabilities of zero, as the central bank and commercial banks matched each other's deposits.
But the central bank gave out significant higher interest with the round-tripping profit going as high as 11%.
Since Lebanese pound and USD were equivalent with the unsustainable peg, this amounted to 11% USD denominated profits.
Not bad, ey?

Ultimately, the people of Lebanon got two raw ends of a deal with the corrupt sectarian political order.
The government had to spend a lot of precious foreign currency on pegging the currency instead of devaluing it which was done with tax payer money.
Secondly, after protests erupted in 2019 the banks closed for an unprecedented two weeks and upon reopening restricted the depositors access to their dollars.
While the black market exchange had already devaluated to a 1/10th of the value, the banks maintained the official peg thus giving their customers significantly less Lebanese pounds for each dollar.
This led to the coinage (pun intended) of the term 'lollar' with the abbreviation 'lol' as the Lebanese people could look at their Dollar statements but had no means of accessing them.
Most Lebanese have given up on the notion that they will one day recover their valuable dollar deposits as they have probably been pilfered to buy the treasury's Eurobonds on which the government defaulted.
Thus the Dollars are most likely gone forever.

Given the nepotism and patronage in the entire sectarian economy this raises the strong case the commercial banks in Lebanon were obviously affiliated with the corrupt power brokers and used the central bank as printing press with USD denominated profits through the peg.
This entire financial engineering scheme amounted to little else than short-term fixes, ensuring that enough foreign currencies where in the country while paying out enormous interest rates to the commercial banks offering USD from the diaspora.
The IMF estimates that the Lebanese commercial banks participating in the scheme made off with 5 billion USD in profits at the expense of the tax payers with the central bank loosing up to 13 billion USD.

Why rob a bank, if you can rob an entire country with it?

### Kleptocracy in Russia

The Russian kleptocratic system is more straight forward and relies more on direct theft than currency manipulation.
But here, too, we have to first go back in time a bit to 1980's in the Soviet Union.

#### A Bit of Historical Context

Supposedly everybody is familiar with 'Star Was', the saga of one messed up family that keeps an entire galaxy busy with its family issues.
It's so popular that Mickey Mouse eventually decided to to buy up the IP to milk it harder than an Irish cow (which has a better life than the Disneyland employees).
Ronald Reagan, being an actor originally who read the likes of Hayek and Friedman on between shoots while on set, pushed ahead with a 'Star Wars' missile defense program which would protect the US from Russian ballistic missiles.
It was the final chapter of a tremendous arms race which had pitted the US and the Soviet Union against each other in the search for ever more advanced weapons.
While eventually being massively overhyped, it did let the Russians realize that they could not win the arms race with their inefficient planned economy.
After a bit more than half a century of planning their economies during which the Soviet Union had been able to pull of tremendous feats of engineering by concentrating labour, resources and a disregard for human necessities, the realization set in among the higher ups in the Soviet economy that they could not sustain the arms race on their own terms.

Even during the darkest economic days of the Soviet Union, there had been a multitude of black market operations who provided the population with a few basic goods.
These operations were mainly run by mostly ethnic outsiders such as Chechens, Jews and Kazakhs.
Due to latent, political and sometimes rampant anti-semitism, Jews often had to struggle to survive in country in which the word 'progrom' had been gained its infamous meaning.
Then criminal enterprises in a country which deemed criminality a capitalist disease and thus couldn't exist in the communist union became a very attractive alternative occupation.
Even nowadays it remains interesting high the percentage of Jewish gangsters is in the criminal scene of Russia given its overall percentage such as Semion Mogilevich (long time on the FBI's most wanted list), Marat Balagula or Evsei Agron.

The KGB as the most powerful security organization was tasked with controlling the black market but quickly realized that they could run their own protection rackets and make money out of the economic misery of their compatriots.
To some extent, the existence of the black market was even timidly encouraged as it eased some of the economic hard ship by increasing the supply, even at inflated prices.
This led to a political-security-criminal nexus in which KGB officers were quick to learn their first lessons in private enterprise.

Then in the 1980's a motley crew of KGB officers and Russian economists began to think about a new hybrid system which could have developed similarly to the Chinese emergence out of communism into hybrid, controlled capitalism.
During the Glasnost & Perestroika period, Gorbatshov became loosening the iron grip on the Soviet Unions political and economic system and urged other Warsaw Pact countries to follow suit.
In 1991, the New Union Treaty was signed due to incessant and increasing unrest of the other Soviet republics which handed more control and independence from Moscow to the individual republics.
Hardliners in the Soviet Unions Communist Party wanted to have none of that and staged a coup on August 19-22 1991.
While the KGB detained Gorbachev at his holiday estate on the Black Sea, they did not arrest Boris Yeltsin who was able to confront the putschists and effectively ended it.
In the wake of the coup the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was effectively dissolved by Yeltsin.

#### The Looting Begins

The East German Stasi had a dedicated department called 'Kommerzielle Koordinierung' for stealing western military and dual use technology as well as procure foreign currency reserves through smuggling.
Initially it was organized under infamous Markus Wolf's espionage department before coming a force of itself, a sign of how important it became to East Germany and in extension to the Soviet Union.
The KGB had developed a similar department for economic and financial logistics in foreign countries.
A multitude of shell companies and banks had been founded and were controlled by the First Main Directorate if the KGB in charge of foreign intelligence.
These shell companies were used to buy resources and material on the international markets as well as transfer money out of the country to causes which were deemed important to the Soviet Union or the KGB.

More often than not though, the profits from the difference between Soviet and market prices were stashed away in the untold bank accounts and companies, control over which was held by the KGB.
The funneling of black cash was done through 'friendly firms' which were shell companies or corrupted real companies through which untraceable money went on its way to its final use.
These were front companies serving just as financial conduits to which other companies wishing to do business in or with the Soviet Union had to pay money for bogus or inflated prices.
These 'friendly firms' could then disburse their enormous profits to fund for example the communist parties in Spain, the UK and France.
Sometimes they were busy with smuggling technology to the Soviet Union or East Germany.

Then there were 'friendly banks' in which the profits of barter deals was stashed.
Often, these 'friendly firms' would buy natural resources, which the Soviet Union had a lot of, at extremely undervalued Soviet Prices and sold them on the world market for the spot price.
Later during Putin's reign as trade chief under Anatoly Sobchack in St. Petersburg, a license was given out to export 13 tons of rare earth metals for 1/2000 th of the current world market price.
The profit margin is directly there in the divisor and the part of the profits of such export deals were then stashed in accounts in 'friendly banks' such as Switzerland's Banco del Gottardo or secrecy jurisdictions like Panama, Hong Kong or the British Channel Islands.
The sums could then be used as slush funds for communist party to destabilize the West or do whatever else they wanted to achieve, but more importantly, they were overseen by the KGB.

As Gorbachev's reform sent the Soviet Union towards unruly chaos, his deputy signed off the intention in August of 1990 to create an 'invisible economy' managed by 'trusted custodians' with a network of shell companies to spirit away the wealth of the Communist Party.
When the Communist Party was dissolved on live TV byt Boris Yeltsin on August 25 1991, this automatically raised the question what would happen to all the money, foreign currencies, property and investements nominally under their control.
Less than three day after Yeltsin had averted the coup in Moscow with a fiery speech on a tank, Nikolay Kruchina, the Parties property department chief, fell out of his window.
A month later, his predecessor Georgy Pavlov fell out of his window as well at the age of 81.
Eleven days Dmitry Lissovolik, the American Section chief of Communist Party's International Department, which oversaw funding of international operations and was thus at the heart of the web of shell companies, fell to his death as well.
All three men had deep insights into the property of the Communist Party which was officially valued at 9 billion USD but unofficially valued at many times over that.
Thus when the new government came looking for the money that the Communist Party had amassed over the last 80 years, they found nothing.

The final theft from the Russian people was done during the privatization of the hugely profitable sectors of the formerly Russian state economy creating the first generation of Russian oligarchs.
The transition of 80 years of planned economy mired in inefficiency, political suppression and corruption towards a free market went as smoothly as one would think.
The government under Boris Yeltsin soon fell on fiscally hard times and was in dire need for cash to keep the country running.

Cooperatives, the Soviet version of private enterprises, were allowed in 1987.
The first round of lopsided privatization occurred with the creation of cooperatives inside large state-owned enterprises which started selling off the huge stockpiles of strategic reservers.
The directors started privatizing the state-owned enterprises from the inside out by controlling the cash flow in the large, still state-owned, enterprises.
Back then, having a positive cash flow allowed you to achieve extraordinary gains in a massively inefficient organize economy.
The government agreed to privatize parts of the Russian economy via a voucher system during a time of rampant hyper inflation when the general population had little nerve for long-term investing.
Additionally, the vast majority of the population were unaccustomed to the idea of investing and owning shares after 80 years of communism.
Since people were more interested in surviving, the company directors, the Russian mafia and other insiders with access to the cash flow were able to buy up large amounts of the share vouchers.

A small addition to the cooperative legislation allowed the creation of banks which is where the real massive privatization of the Russian economy started.
Among the first banks to obtain a foreign currency trading permission was the Menatep bank of Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
Among other schemes, they used the official state exchange rate of 1 USD to 65 kopecks to change roubles into US dollars and buy private computers in the West.
They then sold the computers in Russia with the value being close to 40 roubles for each dollar of import computers.
You can probably see how you can print exponential money by using currency exchange arbitrage and cycling the roubles back through the official state sanctioned exchange rate into dollars.

The original sin of the Russian market economy was the loans-for-shares program, also termed the second wave of privatization.
For reasons unknown or inconvenient at the moment, Boris Yeltsin's government refrained from creating its own treasury and instead simply deposited the governments funds into the oligarchs privately owned banks.
Without doing any work, they could suddenly invest money worth an entire countries budget into high yielding investements.

But the government was still cash-strapped and needed money fast.
The banks agreed to give the government private loans and as collateral took considerable minority stakes in large state-owned enterprises predominantly in the natural resources sector.
When the government coulnd't repay the loans, they were allowed to auction off their stakes and pocket the proceeds.

Yeltsin held the oligarchs politically hostage by receiving the loans before the election but ensuring the auction to sell them off would only occur after the election.
Thus the oligarchs had a massive interest in ensuring Yeltsin reelection.
To little suprise, the government couldn't in fact repay the loans and the oligarchs through their political clout were able to rig the auctions.

Thus Potanin got Norilsk Nickel, the worlds largest nickel and platinum producer, with 1.2 billion USD of profits in 1995 for a mere 175 million USD in the same year.
Khodorkovsky took control of 78 percent of Yukos valued at 5 billion USD for 310 million USD.
Berezovsky took over Sibneft worth around 3 billion USD for just 100 million USD.
After the auctions, Boris Berezovsky remarked that seven bankers now controlled 50 percent of the Russian economy.

The KGB and the company directors tried to fight the take over but were only able to win two out of the numerous auctions.
During one auction, the company directors closed down the closest airport and armed guards blocked the streets to prevent anybody but the company directors to bid in the auction.
It was truly the 'Wild, Wild East'.
Yet, while many of the first generation of oligarchs had been nurtured by the KGB itself, the securocrats quickly found themselves outwitted and outmaneuvered by the freshly minted billionaires.
For an organization steeped in the sense of control over an entire country, this was a moment which was neither forgiven nor forgotten.

The grudges and resentment created during that privatization in which the KGB lost economic control of the country created the vengeance with which the Putin government went after the first generation of oligarchs.
It led to the rise of the 'siloviki', ex-security and military personel, which installed Vladimir Putin in power and viciously took over the country by expropriating the oligarchs or pummeling them into political submission.
