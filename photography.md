Among my most admired photographers are [Fan Ho](https://fanho-forgetmenot.com/portrait-of-hong-kong-1) and [Alan Schaller](http://alanschaller.com).
The photos here are my experiments with light and shadow and playing around with the buttons and dials on my Alpha A7 III.

Best enjoyed in hi-res on your laptop or any other big screen ...
