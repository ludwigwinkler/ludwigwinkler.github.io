				<button type="button" class="collapsible">The Ascent of Money - Niall Ferguson</button>
				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							Niall Ferguson follows the money to tell the human story behind the evolution of our
							financial system, from its genesis in ancient Mesopotamia to the latest upheavals on what he
							calls Planet Finance.
						</p>
						<p>
							What's more, Ferguson reveals financial history as the essential backstory behind all
							history, arguing that the evolution of credit and debt was as important as any technological
							innovation in the rise of civilization.
						</p>
						<p>
							As Ferguson traces the crisis from ancient Egypt's Memphis to today's Chongqing, he offers
							bold and compelling new insights into the rise--and fall--of not just money but Western
							power as well.

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Crashed: How a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World - Adam Tooze</button>
				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							In September 2008 the Great Financial Crisis, triggered by the collapse of Lehman brothers, shook the world. A decade later its spectre still haunts us. 
							As the appalling scope and scale of the crash was revealed, the financial institutions that had symbolised the West's triumph since the end of the Cold War, seemed - through greed, malice and incompetence - to be about to bring the entire system to its knees.
						</p>
						<p>
							Crashed is a brilliantly original and assured analysis of what happened and how we were rescued from something even worse - but at a price which continues to undermine democracy across Europe and the United States. 
							Gnawing away at our institutions are the many billions of dollars which were conjured up to prevent complete collapse. 
							Over and over again, the end of the crisis has been announced, but it continues to hound us - whether in Greece or Ukraine, whether through Brexit or Trump. 
							Adam Tooze follows the trail like no previous writer and has written a book compelling as history, as economic analysis and as political horror story.

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">The Great Deformation - David Stockman</button>
				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							The Great Deformation is a searing look at Washington's craven response to the recent myriad
							of financial crises and fiscal cliffs.
							It counters conventional wisdom with an eighty-year revisionist history of how the American
							state—especially the Federal Reserve—has fallen prey to the politics of crony capitalism and
							the ideologies of fiscal stimulus, monetary central planning, and financial bailouts.
							These forces have left the public sector teetering on the edge of political dysfunction and
							fiscal collapse and have caused America's private enterprise foundation to morph into a
							speculative casino that swindles the masses and enriches the few.
						</p>
						<p>
							Defying right- and left-wing boxes, David Stockman provides a catalogue of corrupters and
							defenders of sound money, fiscal rectitude, and free markets. The former includes Franklin
							Roosevelt, who fathered crony capitalism; Richard Nixon, who destroyed national financial
							discipline and the Bretton Woods gold-backed dollar; Fed chairmen Greenspan and Bernanke,
							who fostered our present scourge of bubble finance and addiction to debt and speculation;
							George W. Bush, who repudiated fiscal rectitude and ballooned the warfare state via
							senseless wars; and Barack Obama, who revived failed Keynesian “borrow and spend” policies
							that have driven the national debt to perilous heights.
							By contrast, the book also traces a parade of statesmen who championed balanced budgets and
							financial market discipline including Carter Glass, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, Bill
							Simon, Paul Volcker, Bill Clinton, and Sheila Bair.
						</p>
						<p>
							Stockman's analysis skewers Keynesian spenders and GOP tax-cutters alike, showing how they
							converged to bloat the welfare state, perpetuate the military-industrial complex, and
							deplete the revenue base—even as the Fed's massive money printing allowed politicians to
							enjoy “deficits without tears.” But these policies have also fueled new financial bubbles
							and favored Wall Street with cheap money and rigged stock and bond markets, while crushing
							Main Street savers and punishing family budgets with soaring food and energy costs. The
							Great Deformation explains how we got here and why these warped, crony capitalist policies
							are an epochal threat to free market prosperity and American political democracy.

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy - Kenneth Pomeranz</button>
				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							The Great Divergence brings new insight to one of the classic questions of history: Why did sustained industrial growth begin in Northwest Europe, despite surprising similarities between advanced areas of Europe and East Asia? 
							As Ken Pomeranz shows, as recently as 1750, parallels between these two parts of the world were very high in life expectancy, consumption, product and factor markets, and the strategies of households. 
							Perhaps most surprisingly, Pomeranz demonstrates that the Chinese and Japanese cores were no worse off ecologically than Western Europe. 
							Core areas throughout the eighteenth-century Old World faced comparable local shortages of land-intensive products, shortages that were only partly resolved by trade.
						</p>
						<p>
							Pomeranz argues that Europe's nineteenth-century divergence from the Old World owes much to the fortunate location of coal, which substituted for timber. 
							This made Europe's failure to use its land intensively much less of a problem, while allowing growth in energy-intensive industries. Another crucial difference that he notes has to do with trade. 
							Fortuitous global conjunctures made the Americas a greater source of needed primary products for Europe than any Asian periphery. 
							This allowed Northwest Europe to grow dramatically in population, specialize further in manufactures, and remove labor from the land, using increased imports rather than maximizing yields. 
							Together, coal and the New World allowed Europe to grow along resource-intensive, labor-saving paths.
						</p>
						<p>
							Meanwhile, Asia hit a cul-de-sac. 
							Although the East Asian hinterlands boomed after 1750, both in population and in manufacturing, this growth prevented these peripheral regions from exporting vital resources to the cloth-producing Yangzi Delta. 
							As a result, growth in the core of East Asia's economy essentially stopped, and what growth did exist was forced along labor-intensive, resource-saving paths--paths Europe could have been forced down, too, had it not been for favorable resource stocks from underground and overseas.

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">The World That Trade Created: Society, Culture, and the World Economy, 1400 to the Present - Kenneth Pomeranz</button>
				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							The World That Trade Created brings to life the history of trade and its actors. In a series of brief, highly readable vignettes, filled with insights and amazing facts about things we tend to take for granted, the authors uncover the deep historical roots of economic globalization.
						</p>
						<p>
							Covering over seven hundred years of history, this book, now in its fourth edition, takes the reader around the world from the history of the opium trade to pirates, to the building of corporations and migration to the New World. 
							The chapters are grouped thematically, each featuring an introductory essay designed to synthesize and elaborate on key themes, both familiar and unfamiliar. 
							It includes ten new essays, on topics ranging from the early modern ivory and slave trades across the Indian Ocean, to the ways in which the availability of new consumer goods helped change work habits in both Europe and East Asia, and from the history of chewing gum to that of rare earth metals. 
							The introductory essays for each chapter, the overall introduction and epilogue, and several of the essays have also been revised and updated.

							Americans, sub-Saharan Africans, and aboriginal Australians.

				<h3>History</h3>

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">The Lemon Tree - Sandy Tolan</button>
				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							In 1967, Bashir Al-Khayri, a Palestinian twenty-five-year-old, journeyed to Israel, with the
							goal of seeing the beloved old stone house, with the lemon tree behind it, that he and his
							family had fled nineteen years earlier.
							To his surprise, when he found the house he was greeted by Dalia Ashkenazi Landau, a
							nineteen-year-old Israeli college student, whose family fled Europe for Israel following the
							Holocaust.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the stoop of their shared home, Dalia and Bashir began a rare friendship, forged in the
							aftermath of war and tested over the next thirty-five years in ways that neither could
							imagine on that summer day in 1967.
							Based on extensive research, and springing from his enormously resonant documentary that
							aired on NPR's Fresh Air in 1998, Sandy Tolan brings the Israeli-Palestinian conflict down
							to its most human level, suggesting that even amid the bleakest political realities there
							exist stories of hope and reconciliation.

						<p>
							In 1683, an Ottoman army that stretched from horizon to horizon set out to seize the “Golden
							Apple,” as Turks referred to Vienna.
							The ensuing siege pitted battle-hardened Janissaries wielding seventeenth-century grenades
							against Habsburg armies, widely feared for their savagery.
							The walls of Vienna bristled with guns as the besieging Ottoman host launched bombs, fired

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Rise and Kill First - Ronen Bergman</button>
				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							The Talmud says: “If someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first.” This instinct
							to take every measure, even the most aggressive, to defend the Jewish people is hardwired
							into Israel’s DNA. From the very beginning of its statehood in 1948, protecting the nation
							from harm has been the responsibility of its intelligence community and armed services, and
							there is one weapon in their vast arsenal that they have relied upon to thwart the most
							serious threats: Targeted assassinations have been used countless times, on enemies large
							and small, sometimes in response to attacks against the Israeli people and sometimes
							preemptively.
						</p>
						<p>

							Bergman has gained the exceedingly rare cooperation of many current and former members of
							the Israeli government, including Prime Ministers Shimon Peres, Ehud Barak, Ariel Sharon,
							and Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as high-level figures in the country’s military and
							intelligence services: the IDF (Israel Defense Forces), the Mossad (the world’s most feared
							intelligence agency), Caesarea (a “Mossad within the Mossad” that carries out attacks on the
							highest-value targets), and the Shin Bet (an internal security service that implemented the
							largest targeted assassination campaign ever, in order to stop what had once appeared to be
							unstoppable: suicide terrorism).
						</p>
						<p>
							Including never-before-reported, behind-the-curtain accounts of key operations, and based on
							hundreds of on-the-record interviews and thousands of files to which Bergman has gotten
							exclusive access over his decades of reporting, Rise and Kill First brings us deep into the
							heart of Israel’s most secret activities. Bergman traces, from statehood to the present, the
							gripping events and thorny ethical questions underlying Israel’s targeted killing campaign,
							which has shaped the Israeli nation, the Middle East, and the entire world.

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">Identity - Francis Fukuyama</button>
				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							Currently in Bill Gates's bookbag and FT Books of 2018 Increasingly, the demands of identity
							direct the world's politics. Nation, religion, sect, race, ethnicity, gender: these
							categories have overtaken broader, inclusive ideas of who we are.
							We have built walls rather than bridges. The result: increasing in anti-immigrant sentiment,
							rioting on college campuses, and the return of open white supremacy to our politics.
						</p>
						<p>
							In 2014, Francis Fukuyama wrote that American and global institutions were in a state of
							decay, as the state was captured by powerful interest groups.
							Two years later, his predictions were borne out by the rise to power of a series of
							political outsiders whose economic nationalism and authoritarian tendencies threatens to
							destabilise the entire international order.
						</p>
						<p>
							These populist nationalists seek direct charismatic connection to 'the people', who are
							usually defined in narrow identity terms that offer an irresistible call to an in-group and
							exclude large parts of the population as a whole.
						</p>
						<p>
							Identity is an urgent and necessary book: a sharp warning that unless we forge a universal

							In his bestselling The End of History and the Last Man, Francis Fukuyama argued that the end of the Cold War would also mean the beginning of a struggle for position in the rapidly emerging order of 21st-century capitalism. 
							In Trust, a penetrating assessment of the emerging global economic order "after History," he explains the social principles of economic life and tells us what we need to know to win the coming struggle for world dominance. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Challenging orthodoxies of both the left and right, Fukuyama examines a wide range of national cultures in order to divine the underlying principles that foster social and economic prosperity. 
							Insisting that we cannot divorce economic life from cultural life, he contends that in an era when social capital may be as important as physical capital, only those societies with a high degree of social trust will be able to create the flexible, large-scale business organizations that are needed to compete in the new global economy. 
						</p>
						<p>
							A brilliant study of the interconnectedness of economic life with cultural life, Trust is also an essential antidote to the increasing drift of American culture into extreme forms of individualism, which, if unchecked, will have dire consequences for the nation's economic health.

						<p>
							In The Origins of Political Order, Francis Fukuyama took us from the dawn of mankind to the
							French and American Revolutions.
							Here, he picks up the thread again in the second instalment of his definitive account of
							mankind's emergence as a political animal.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is the story of how state, law and democracy developed after these cataclysmic events,
							how the modern landscape - with its uneasy tension between dictatorships and liberal
							democracies - evolved and how in the United States and in other developed democracies,
							unmistakable signs of decay have emerged.
							If we want to understand the political systems that dominate and order our lives, we must
							first address their origins - in our own recent past as well as in the earliest systems of
							human government.
						</p>
						<p>
							Fukuyama argues that the key to successful government can be reduced to three key elements:
							a strong state, the rule of law and institutions of democratic accountability.
							This magisterial account is required reading for anyone wishing to know more about mankind's
							greatest achievements.

							Virtually all human societies were once organized tribally, yet over time most developed new political institutions that included a central state that could keep the peace and uniform laws that applied to all citizens. 
							Some went on to create governments that were accountable to their constituents. 
							We take these institutions for granted, but they are absent or unable to function in many of today’s developing countries—with often disastrous consequences for the rest of the world.
						</p>
						<p>
							Francis Fukuyama, author of the best-selling The End of History and The Last Man, and one of our most important political thinkers, provides a sweeping account of how today’s basic political institutions developed.
							The first of a major two-volume work, The Origins of Political Order begins with politics among our primate ancestors and follows the story through the emergence of tribal societies, the growth of the first modern state in China, the beginning of the rule of law in India and the Middle East, and the development of political accountability in Europe up until the eve of the French Revolution.
						</p>
						<p>
							Drawing on a vast body of knowledge—history, evolutionary biology, archaeology, and economics—Fukuyama has produced a brilliant, provocative work that offers fresh insights on the origins of democratic societies and raises essential questions about the nature of politics and its discontents.

						<p>
							Humans are tribal. We need to belong to groups. 
							In many parts of the world, the group identities that matter most – the ones that people will kill and die for – are ethnic, religious, sectarian, or clan-based. 
							But because America tends to see the world in terms of nation-states engaged in great ideological battles – Capitalism vs. Communism, Democracy vs. Authoritarianism, the “Free World” vs. the “Axis of Evil” – we are often spectacularly blind to the power of tribal politics. 
							Time and again this blindness has undermined American foreign policy.  
						</p>
						<p>
							In the Vietnam War, viewing the conflict through Cold War blinders, we never saw that most of Vietnam’s “capitalists” were members of the hated Chinese minority. 
							Every pro-free-market move we made helped turn the Vietnamese people against us. In Iraq, we were stunningly dismissive of the hatred between that country’s Sunnis and Shias. 
							If we want to get our foreign policy right – so as to not be perpetually caught off guard and fighting unwinnable wars – the United States has to come to grips with political tribalism abroad.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just as Washington’s foreign policy establishment has been blind to the power of tribal politics outside the country, so too have American political elites been oblivious to the group identities that matter most to ordinary Americans – and that are tearing the United States apart. 
							As the stunning rise of Donald Trump laid bare, identity politics have seized both the American left and right in an especially dangerous, racially inflected way.  In America today, every group feels threatened: whites and blacks, Latinos and Asians, men and women, liberals and conservatives, and so on. 
							There is a pervasive sense of collective persecution and discrimination. 
							On the left, this has given rise to increasingly radical and exclusionary rhetoric of privilege and cultural appropriation. On the right, it has fueled a disturbing rise in xenophobia and white nationalism.

							Is social media destroying democracy? Are Russian propaganda or "Fake news" entrepreneurs on Facebook undermining our sense of a shared reality? 
							A conventional wisdom has emerged since the election of Donald Trump in 2016 that new technologies and their manipulation by foreign actors played a decisive role in his victory and are responsible for the sense of a "post-truth" moment in which disinformation and propaganda thrives.
						</p>
						<p>
							Network Propaganda challenges that received wisdom through the most comprehensive study yet published on media coverage of American presidential politics from the start of the election cycle in April 2015 to the one year anniversary of the Trump presidency. 
							Analysing millions of news stories together with Twitter and Facebook shares, broadcast television and YouTube, the book provides a comprehensive overview of the architecture of contemporary American political communications. 
							Through data analysis and detailed qualitative case studies of coverage of immigration, Clinton scandals, and the Trump Russia investigation, the book finds that the right-wing media ecosystem operates fundamentally differently than the rest of the media environment. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The authors argue that longstanding institutional, political, and cultural patterns in American politics interacted with technological change since the 1970s to create a propaganda feedback loop in American conservative media. 
							This dynamic has marginalized centre-right media and politicians, radicalized the right wing ecosystem, and rendered it susceptible to propaganda efforts, foreign and domestic. 
							For readers outside the United States, the book offers a new perspective and methods for diagnosing the sources of, and potential solutions for, the perceived global crisis of democratic politics.

				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							Raghuram Rajan, distinguished University of Chicago professor, former IMF chief economist, head of India's central bank, and author of the 2010 FT-Goldman-Sachs Book of the Year Fault Lines, has an unparalleled vantage point onto the social and economic consequences of globalization and their ultimate effect on our politics. 
							In The Third Pillar he offers up a magnificent big-picture framework for understanding how these three forces--the state, markets, and our communities--interact, why things begin to break down, and how we can find our way back to a more secure and stable plane. 
						</p>
						<p>
							The "third pillar" of the title is the community we live in. Economists all too often understand their field as the relationship between markets and the state, and they leave squishy social issues for other people. That's not just myopic, Rajan argues; it's dangerous. 
							All economics is actually socioeconomics - all markets are embedded in a web of human relations, values and norms. 
							As he shows, throughout history, technological phase shifts have ripped the market out of those old webs and led to violent backlashes, and to what we now call populism. Eventually, a new equilibrium is reached, but it can be ugly and messy, especially if done wrong. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Right now, we're doing it wrong. As markets scale up, the state scales up with it, concentrating economic and political power in flourishing central hubs and leaving the periphery to decompose, figuratively and even literally. 
							Instead, Rajan offers a way to rethink the relationship between the market and civil society and argues for a return to strengthening and empowering local communities as an antidote to growing despair and unrest. Rajan is not a doctrinaire conservative, so his ultimate argument that decision-making has to be devolved to the grass roots or our democracy will continue to wither, is sure to be provocative. 
							But even setting aside its solutions, The Third Pillar is a masterpiece of explication, a book that will be a classic of its kind for its offering of a wise, authoritative and humane explanation of the forces that have wrought such a sea change in our lives.

					<dd>
						<p>
							Attention merchant: an industrial-scale harvester of human attention. A firm whose business model is the mass capture of attention for resale to advertisers.
							In nearly every moment of our waking lives, we face a barrage of advertising enticements, branding efforts, sponsored social media, commercials and other efforts to harvest our attention. Over the last century, few times or spaces have remained uncultivated by the 'attention merchants', contributing to the distracted, unfocused tenor of our times. 
							Tim Wu argues that this is not simply the byproduct of recent inventions but the end result of more than a century's growth and expansion in the industries that feed on human attention. 
							From the pre-Madison Avenue birth of advertising to TV's golden age to our present age of radically individualized choices, the business model of 'attention merchants' has always been the same. 
							He describes the revolts that have risen against these relentless attempts to influence our consumption, from the remote control to FDA regulations to Apple's ad-blocking OS. 
							But he makes clear that attention merchants grow ever-new heads, and their means of harvesting our attention have given rise to the defining industries of our time, changing our nature - cognitive, social, and otherwise - in ways unimaginable even a generation ago.

						<p>
							The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called "surveillance capitalism," and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control us.
							The heady optimism of the Internet's early days is gone. 
							Technologies that were meant to liberate us have deepened inequality and stoked divisions. 
							Tech companies gather our information online and sell it to the highest bidder, whether government or retailer. 
							Profits now depend not only on predicting our behaviour but modifying it too. How will this fusion of capitalism and the digital shape our values and define our future?
						</p>
						<p>
							Shoshana Zuboff shows that we are at a crossroads. 
							We still have the power to decide what kind of world we want to live in, and what we decide now will shape the rest of the century. 
							Our choices: allow technology to enrich the few and impoverish the many, or harness it and distribute its benefits.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a deeply-reasoned examination of the threat of unprecedented power free from democratic oversight. 
							As it explores this new capitalism's impact on society, politics, business, and technology, it exposes the struggles that will decide both the next chapter of capitalism and the meaning of information civilization. 
							Most critically, it shows how we can protect ourselves and our communities and ensure we are the masters of the digital rather than its slaves.

						<p>
							Over 6.4 billion people participate in a $36.5 trillion global economy, designed and overseen by no one. How did this marvel of self-organized complexity evolve? 
							How is wealth created within this system? And how can wealth be increased for the benefit of individuals, businesses, and society? 
						</p>
						<p>	
							In The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker argues that modern science provides a radical perspective on these age-old questions, with far-reaching implications. 
							According to Beinhocker, wealth creation is the product of a simple but profoundly powerful evolutionary formula: differentiate, select, and amplify. 
							In this view, the economy is a "complex adaptive system" in which physical technologies, social technologies, and business designs continuously interact to create novel products, new ideas, and increasing wealth. 
							Taking readers on an entertaining journey through economic history, from the Stone Age to modern economy, Beinhocker explores how "complexity economics" provides provocative insights on issues ranging from creating adaptive organizations to the evolutionary workings of stock markets to new perspectives on government policies. 
							A landmark book that shatters conventional economic theory, The Origin of Wealth will rewire our thinking about how we came to be here--and where we are going.

						<p>
							Thomas Pikettys bestselling Capital in the Twenty-First Century galvanized global debate about inequality. In this audacious follow-up, Piketty challenges us to revolutionize how we think about politics, ideology, and history. 
							He exposes the ideas that have sustained inequality for the past millennium, reveals why the shallow politics of right and left are failing us today, and outlines the structure of a fairer economic system.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our economy, Piketty observes, is not a natural fact. Markets, profits, and capital are all historical constructs that depend on choices. 
							Piketty explores the material and ideological interactions of conflicting social groups that have given us slavery, serfdom, colonialism, communism, and hypercapitalism, shaping the lives of billions. 
							He concludes that the great driver of human progress over the centuries has been the struggle for equality and education and not, as often argued, the assertion of property rights or the pursuit of stability. 
							The new era of extreme inequality that has derailed that progress since the 1980s, he shows, is partly a reaction against communism, but it is also the fruit of ignorance, intellectual specialization, and our drift toward the dead-end politics of identity. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Once we understand this, we can begin to envision a more balanced approach to economics and politics. 
							Piketty argues for a new participatory socialism, a system founded on an ideology of equality, social property, education, and the sharing of knowledge and power. 
							Capital and Ideology is destined to be one of the indispensable books of our time, a work that will not only help us understand the world, but that will change it.

							Government interventions in media markets are often criticized for preventing audiences from getting the media products they want. A free press is often asserted to be essential for democracy. 
							The first point is incorrect and the second is inadequate as a policy guide. Part I of this book shows that unique aspects of media products prevent markets from providing for audience desires. 
							Part II shows that four prominent, but different, theories of democracy lead to different conceptions of good journalistic practice, media policy, and proper constitutional principles. 
							Part II makes clear that the choice among democratic theories is crucial for understanding what should be meant by free press. Part III explores international free trade in media products.

							Founded by John Meriweather, a notoriously confident bond dealer, along with two Nobel prize
							winners and a floor of Wall Street's brightest and best, Long-Term Captial Management was
							from the beginning hailed as a new gold standard in investing.
							It was to be the hedge fund to end all other hedge funds: a discreet private investment club
							limited to those rich enough to pony up millions.
							It became the banks' own favourite fund and from its inception achieved a run of dizzyingly
							spectacular returns. New investors barged each other aside to get their investment money
							into LTCM's hands.
						</p>
						<p>
							But as competitors began to mimic Meriweather's fund, he altered strategy to maintain the
							fund's performance, leveraging capital with credit on a scale not fully understood and never
							seen before.
						</p>
						<p>
							When the markets in Indonesia, South America and Russia crashed in 1998 LCTM's investments
							crashed with them and mountainous debts accumulated.
							The fund was in melt-down, and threatening to bring down into its trillion-dollar black hole
							a host of financial instiutions from New York to Switzerland.
							It's a tale of vivid characters, overwheening ambition, and perilous drama told, in Roger
							Lowenstein's hands, with brilliant style and panache.

						<p>
							Jim Simons is the greatest money maker in modern financial history. 
							No other investor--Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, or George Soros--can touch his record. 
							Since 1988, Renaissance's signature Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent. The firm has earned profits of more than $100 billion; Simons is worth twenty-three billion dollars.
						</p>
						<p>
							Drawing on unprecedented access to Simons and dozens of current and former employees, Zuckerman, a veteran Wall Street Journal investigative reporter, tells the gripping story of how a world-class mathematician and former code breaker mastered the market. 
							Simons pioneered a data-driven, algorithmic approach that's sweeping the world.
						</p>
						<p>
							As Renaissance became a market force, its executives began influencing the world beyond finance. 
							Simons became a major figure in scientific research, education, and liberal politics. 
							Senior executive Robert Mercer is more responsible than anyone else for the Trump presidency, placing Steve Bannon in the campaign and funding Trump's victorious 2016 effort. Mercer also impacted the campaign behind Brexit.
						</p>
						<p>
						The Man Who Solved the Market is a portrait of a modern-day Midas who remade markets in his own image, but failed to anticipate how his success would impact his firm and his country. It's also a story of what Simons's revolution means for the rest of us.

				<button type="button" class="collapsible">The Coddling of the American Mind - Jonathan Haidt</button>
				<div class="content">
					<dd>
						<p>
							Something has been going wrong on many college campuses in the last few years. Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and are afraid to speak honestly. 
							Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising—on campus as well as nationally. How did this happen?
						</p>
						<p>
							First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and education: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. 
							These three Great Untruths contradict basic psychological principles about well-being and ancient wisdom from many cultures. 
							Embracing these untruths—and the resulting culture of safetyism—interferes with young people’s social, emotional, and intellectual development. It makes it harder for them to become autonomous adults who are able to navigate the bumpy road of life.
						</p>
							Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to promote the spread of these untruths. 
							They explore changes in childhood such as the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised, child-directed play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade. 
							They examine changes on campus, including the corporatization of universities and the emergence of new ideas about identity and justice. They situate the conflicts on campus within the context of America’s rapidly rising political polarization and dysfunction.
						<p>
							This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines.

							herself in the work of classical masters like Bach and Brahms.
							She was just ten years old when she began a rigorous course of study at the Beijing
							Conservatory, laying the groundwork for what was sure to be an extraordinary career.
							But in 1966, when Xiao-Mei was seventeen, the Cultural Revolution began, and life as she
							knew it changed forever. One by one, her family members were scattered, sentenced to prison
							or labor camps.
						</p>
						<p>
							By 1969, the art schools had closed, and Xiao-Mei was on her way to a work camp in Mongolia,
							where she would spend the next five years.
							Life in the camp was nearly unbearable, thanks to horrific living conditions and intensive
							brainwashing campaigns. Yet through it all Xiao-Mei clung to her passion for music and her
							sense of humor.

						<p>
							And when the Revolution ended, it was the piano that helped her to heal. Heartbreaking and
