## Introduction

This is a talk I gave at the Berlin Machine Learning Seminar hosted by Ben in the offices of [Lateral](https://lateral.io).
It serves as an introduction to reinforcement learning covering the usual suspects like on- and off-policy algorithms, TD-learning and shows how neural networks were used as function approximators in deep reinforcement learning.

The talk can be downloaded [here](BML-RL.pdf).
