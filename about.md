## Some Info about Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/LudwigWinkler_AlexSmall.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I spent my kindergarten and elementary school years in Austin, Texas where, among other things, I enjoyed the best BBQ west of the Mississippi.
During high school I lived in Lille, France where I learned French and experienced superb food and the charming little differences between Germany and France.
After graduating from high school I wanted to learn more about China and the Chinese language and did my volunteer community service in China, working as a volunteer teacher in a local kindergarten in the suburbs of Beijing.

Before my graduate studies at the TU Berlin, I did my undergraduate studies in biomedical engineering at the [Pattern Recognition Lab](https://www5.cs.fau.de) at FAU Erlangen-Nurnberg.
I mostly worked on machine learning for medical images and computer vision.
On the side I was an assistant teacher for the 'Signals & Systems I/II' lectures for a year where I oversaw the exercises and tutored younger students taking the class.

It was in fact speech recognition that sparked my interest in machine learning and I am very grateful to [Elmar Nöth](https://www5.cs.fau.de/our-team/noeth-elmar) who introduced me to academic conferences as an undergraduate student and enabled me to be a volunteer at the [Interspeech conference](http://www.interspeech2016.org) in 2015 and 2016.
Talking about machine learning, one could say that 'speech made me do it', since it still up to this day fascinates me how mathematicians, computational linguists and computer scientists are able to decode something seemingly so intricate as the human speech.
Since then my interest has shifted to neural machine translation and reinforcement learning, which pose yet unsolved tasks in machine learning.
<!-- After the 2016 Interspeech, I did a kick-ass road trip through the Western United States where we drove 7.000km from San Francisco, California through Austin, Texas and finishing in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. -->

Now I'm a graduate student at the TU Berlin where I also work as an assistant student researcher at the Machine Learning Group.
In Berlin, [Wendelin Böhmer](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/wendelin.boehmer/) sparked my interest in reinforcement learning which subsequently became the focus of my research work.
Currently I am writing my master's thesis on reinforcement learning with Bayesian neural networks, and we'll see whether that even works respectively where it will lead me. =)
