This summary delves deeper into the function and origin of the British offshore financial system which has played a pivotal role at creating the offshore financial industy which rests mostly on subterfuge and illicit money streams.

### The City of London

There is a small district right in the middle of London which is quite peculiar in its nature: the City of London.
Per se it is a simple local administration taking care of things every administration does: building roads and parks, making sure taxes are paid and providing other public services.

It traces its roots to Roman settlements and has continuously existed for close to 1000 years or more.
One thing the City of London is famous for is that it can claim to be the longest running municipal administration when King William gave the City of London the 'William charter' in 1067 establishing a basic rule of law.

Over time the City won more concessions from the British crown and was able to outlive queens, kings and wars by positioning itself as a center for trade and commerce.
Conspicuously enough, one stated objective of the City of London is to promote its financial services industry.
While most countries taciturnly agree on promoting their local industries, the City of London is insteresting insofar that it's government has put the promotion of its very own financial services industry right next to policing and the provision of other municipial services. 

### The British Empire

The British empire at its height in 1913, the British empire held sway over 413 millione people (23%) and 24% of land worldwide, although its dominions Australia and Canada, as well as India made up big chunks of that.

In the book 'The Anarchy' about the rise of the British East India Corporation (EIC), Charles Dalrymple mentiones that the rise of the EIC was among other factors greatly facilitated by the superior financial system the British could muster.

Now it is commonly agreed upon that the splintering of the Indian monarchy was due to giving out taxation rights to subordinated generals and patrons, which by themselves were inherently not interested in passing on collected taxes to the Raj.
This in turn deprived the Raj of income with which he could tackle new projects and consolidate his power.

At the same time, the highly developed financial system mainly based in London was able to quickly move large amounts of money through the British sphere of influence.
Often battles were not even fought as opponents were simply bought off with large sums of cash or pivotal supporting army generals were paid to not show up at the side of their Indian allies by the British.
Similarly the British were well regarded by the local sepoys (Indian natives serving as soldiers) as paying salaries consistently on time.

The enormous extent of the British empire gave the chaps back in London in the financial services sector a lot to do, since there were alwasy bridges to be build, insurance contracts to be signed and loans to be made across the whole wide world under a single economic system.

London, and more specifically the City of London, thus developed to the most important financial center in the world under the auspice of the British empire.

But as we all know: All good things come to an end ...

### Decline of the British Empire

Having lost its role as the premier world power to the US after World War 2, Britain had a hard time adjusting to this new reality.
This was especially hard on the public school (public schools are the prestigous schools in the UK) educated generation that has and still forms the backbone of higher public office in the UK.
In half a generation, these mostly men watched their once great empire dissolving and their once proud status reduced to just another European power.

When Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez canal, which was and still is of profound importance to world trade, the three countries of France, Britain and Israel decided on having Israel invade Egypt.
Under the pretense of keeping peace, the British and the French would then move in and bring back the Suez canal under European control.

Unfortunately for conspiratorial countries, the US would have none of that.
General Abdel Nasser had certain sympathies for the socialist/communist cause and the US were afraid that the entire Arab cultural sphere would move closer to the Soviet Union which would have spelled doom on the West's interest in Middle Eastern oil.

The escalating crisis and the dressing down of the UK caused a run on the Sterling.
The Bank of England (BoE) tried to support the Sterling but it ultimately cost it 450Mio USD which essentially bankrupted the BoE.

This was a harsh new reality for the British chaps in their Savile Row suits as they had to recognize that the weren't the biggest dog in the dog park anymore ... still large but not the biggest.

Another cause of concern for the City of London was the capital control system introduced through the Bretton Woods system.
The two world wars had made the US the largest holder of Gold in the world which was quite something when all currencies had a fixed exchange rate to Gold.
(We now live in a world of fiat currencies, in which the value of almost every currency is determined on a sell-buy market through supply and demand.)
With the loans made to the UK (which passed those loans partially further along to France) during World War 1 and partially World War 2, the UK bought commodities and products from the US to keep on fighting the Germans.

This made the US the biggest player in the Gold market and after the complete or partial destruction of almost every other industrialized nation also the most important economy in the world (a title they still hold to this day).

At Bretton Woods in 1944 John Maynard Keynes proposed a global currency to conduct world wide trade but the US weren't too keen on that idea as it undermined their powerful position as the worlds largest holder of Gold reserves.
So the US dollar became the world reserve currency at 35 USD for one ounce of gold and every other currency could pick their peg with a some wiggle room of 1% around this peg for the central banks to work with.

The memories of the global financial crisis of 1929 were just 15 years old and the crisis itself as well as WWII as a direct political consequence of too much speculation was still remembered vividly by the economists at Bretton Woods.
Thus they agreed on capital controls, sovereign monetary policy and fixed exchange rates to allows countries more autonomy in determining their economic course.
The capital controls were very much to the detriment of the banks and more specifically London which relied on the free flow of capital across borders in a de-colonialized world.


Capital Control vs Free Exchange Rate vs Autonomie: after 1929 public policy was firmly against free and hot money

Free capital flows will leave as soon as low interest rates for economic stimulation are set

Keynes was for Capital Control

### The EuroMarket

tug of war between British politicians and once glorious British bankers

British bankers wanted to lend outside

Treasury forbid it due to control capital outflows

British banking club atmosphere without strict supervision allowed banks to simply do their lending in any currency other than Sterling, British overesight didn't give a damn for the glory of old British dominance

regulatory vacuum created by BoE that was filled by EuroMarket

Two sets of books on same desk

Soviet union held dollars in France and London in Moscow Narodny Bank to keep them outside of US, 'Euro' telex adress 
Midland Bank (now part of HSBC) simply borrowed the USD and the BoE didn't care to regulate ML37, TI88, BW46

1963 Eurobonds: bearer bonds

1960 1B USD, 1970 46B USD, 1980 500B, 1988 2.6T, 1997 90% international loans in London Euromarket TI92

lax oversight, having a cup of tea TI98

TI93 loan example

Also in interest of US dollars as global reserve currency

## City of London

The origin of the offshore financial industry lies between St Pauls cathedral and the Tower of London.
It is a small district which yields disproportional influence over the world and is practically beholden to no one: the City of London.


## Deregulation

from 1950 to 1975 unusual long prosperity (Glorieux Trenteuse in France) despite high tax rate 4 to 4.6% TI p77

2006 lower hourly wage of worker after inflation than 1970

1973 to 2000: 17 banking crises and 57 currency crises vs 16 before

US deregulation 1974 [?]

### The Big Bang 1986



### The Second British Empire

Hub-and-spoke around City of London
1/3 in spokes to 1/2 spokes+hub of bank assets

Cayman Islands: 80.000 companies, 5th largest financial center, 3/4 of worlds hedge funds and one cinema

Crown Dependencies are not part of European Union: chief negotatior adamantly insisted on taxation autonomy
