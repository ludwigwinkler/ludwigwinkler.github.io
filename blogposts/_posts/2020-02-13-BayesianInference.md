This is a talk I was invited to give at Europe's largest robo advisor [Scalable Capital](https://uk.scalable.capital) in Munich .
It serves as an introduction to Bayesian Inference covering the two main approaches of Markov [Chain Monte Carlo sampling](https://ludwigwinkler.github.io/blog/HMC/) and Variational Inference.
It is fairly high-level since it was given to a large audience with diverse professional backgrounds.

The slides can be downloaded [here](BayesML.pdf) with corrected typos.
