### The advantages of public private key encryption

We are all used to having access to secure communication that we seldomly ask ourselves how the encryption that keeps prying eyes from reading our messages actually works.

What is in fact the best way to **establish** secure communications?

More importantly, a big question is how we actually establish secure communication.
In most secret agent movies, there exists a cypher which allows the hero, or the villain, to decode a hidden or encrypted text into its original meaning.
Either it's selecting specific letters from the newspaper or it's running a tremendously exciting looking algorithm over some text files on a computer.
But in both cases the hero, or the villain, is already in possession of the knowledge how to decrypt the encrypted text.

But how did he obtain it knowledge to decrypt the encrypted text?

Certainly, it's very dangerous to simply send the decryption key, whatever form it may take, through the plain mail.
It could get intercepted and copied, rendering any further encrypted communication worthless, as the copied decryption key allows the interceptor to decrypt of the secret message.

The answer lies in asymmetric cryptography.

The best analogy that I can think of is, that the person who wants to receive encrypted messages passes out publicly an abundance of **open** locks to which only he has the key to unlock them.
So another person who wants to send you encrypted messages can simply pick up a publicly available open lock, but the message inside, lock it and send you the message.
Since only you have the key to all of these locks, you're the only one who can open the lock and actually look at what you were sent.
If you were to reply, you would simply pick up a lock that the other persons has publicly on offer, lock you message up and send him or her your message.

This concept is nice in theory, but how would it work technicall and mathematically?
Let us establish some basics first which will be important down the road.

### Modulo: The Secret Sauce of RSA IMHO

The modulo operator $x \ mod \ n$ takes any number $x$ and returns the remainder after the division with $n$.
Let's say you want to know $x \ mod \ n$, then we can represent $x$ as $x= k n + r$ for an integer $k$ and the remainder $r$.
The modulo operator is in fact not very complicated and it should be clear after a few examples:

$$
\begin{align}
  x \mod \ n &= r \quad \text{since}  \quad &&  x = k * n + r    && \quad \text{with} \quad k \in \mathbb{N}, r \in \mathbb{N} \\ \\
  9 \mod \ 2 &= 1 \quad \text{since}  \quad &&  9 = 4 * 2 + 1    && \quad \text{with} \quad k=4, r=1 \\
  13 \mod \ 2 &= 1 \quad \text{since} \quad && 13 = 6 * 2 + 1    && \quad \text{with} \quad k=6, r=1 \\ \\
  5 \mod \ 3 &= 2 \quad \text{since}  \quad && 5  = 1 * 3 + 2    && \quad \text{with} \quad k=1, r=2 \\
  8 \mod \ 3 &= 2 \quad \text{since}  \quad && 8  = 2 * 3 + 2    && \quad \text{with} \quad k=2, r=2 \\
\end{align}
$$

I chose the examples with care to highlight a natural property of the modulo operator which makes it so appealing to cryptography.
Namely, that we apply the modulo operator on different numbers and will obtain the same remainder.
If you're only left with the number $n$ and the remainder $r$, there is no way to obtain the original number $x$.
The modulo operator is basically a one way operation which hides the original number $x$!
The properties of the modulo function that will be important to us only consider large integer values.

### Coprime Integers

The next ingredient that is required are coprime integers.
'Coprime' might sound threatening and complicated but in fact the definition is quite simple.
Two integer numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor is 1, $\text{gcd}(a, b)=1$ for $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$.

In laymen's terms, this means that both numbers are divisible into an integer only by the number of one.
So for example, 3 and 5 are coprime because 1 is the largest integer divisor of both of them.
The numbers 3 and 15 and not coprime because the greatest common denominator is 3.
The latter example is still divisible by 1 as well, but we're talking about the *greatest* common divisor of two integer numbers.

### Eulers Totient

For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, Euler's totient is given as the number of integer numbers $m$ that are in the set

$$
\begin{align}
\phi(n) = \{m \in \mathbb{N} \ | \ 1 \leq m \leq n, \text{gcd}(m, n) = 1 \}
\end{align}
$$

which essentially means that we want the number of integers that are smaller than $n$ and are coprime to $n$.
As an example let's look at $$ \phi(9) = | \{1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 \} |  = 6 $$.
The numbers 3, 6 and 9 are not members of $\phi(9)$ because their greatest common divisor is 3, so the restriction $\text{gcd}(\\\{ 3,6,9 \\\}, 9) =1$ does not hold.

More importantly for our application, Euler's totient is a multiplicative function for two numbers which are relatively prime, or coprime, to each other.

$$
\begin{align}
  \phi(n) = \phi(pq) = \phi(p) \phi(q) \quad ; \text{gcd}(p, q)=1
\end{align}
$$

### Eulers Theorem: The Bedrock of RSA

The impressive Leonhard Euler ( I mean come on, the guy lived 250 years ago and so much of our modern technological applications are based on his math) found out that if $n$ and $a$ are coprime, the following identity holds:

$$
\left[ a^{\phi(n)} = 1 \right] \mod \ n.
$$

The notation $[ \ldots ] \mod n$ means that we apply the modulo equally to both sides. The notation $\ldots = \ldots (\mod n)$ is more common but I like my paranthesis to clearly delineate what operator we apply to what.

Now it turns out that we can massage Euler's Theorem into a very useful form, namely
$$
\begin{align}
  \Big[ a^{\phi(n)}       &= 1 \Big] \mod \ n \\
  \Big[ a^{k\phi(n)}      &= 1 \Big] \mod \ n \\
\end{align}
$$

Right here we smuggled in the integer number $k$ in the exponentiation.
In order to prove the validity of this step, we can construct the following 'proof' (Hey, I ain't no mathematician, but at least the math checks out),

$$
\begin{align}
  \Big[ a^{k\phi(n)}      = 1 \Big] \mod \ n \\
  \Big[ {\big( a^{\phi(n)} \big) }^k      = 1 \Big] \mod \ n \\
  \Big[ \prod_i^k {\big( a^{\phi(n)} \big) }      = 1 \Big] \mod \ n \\
\end{align}
$$
for which we can now employ the transitivity rule which states that

$$
\begin{align}
  & \Big[ ab \Big] \mod n \\
  =& \Big[ [a] \ \text{mod} \ n \cdot [b] \ \text{mod} \ n \Big] \mod n \\
\end{align}
$$

which gives us

$$
\begin{align}
  \Big[ \prod_i^k {\big( a^{\phi(n)} \big) }      = 1 \Big] \mod \ n \\
  \Bigg[ \prod_i^k \Big( \Big[ \underbrace{a^{\phi(n)} \Big] \ \text{mod} \ n}_{=1} \Big)      = 1 \Bigg] \mod \ n \\
  \Bigg[ \prod_i^k \Big( 1 \Big)      = 1 \Bigg] \mod \ n \\
  \Bigg[  1   = 1 \Bigg] \mod \ n.
\end{align}
$$

which proves that we can add an integer multiplier in the exponent.
Carrying on we have

$$
\begin{align}
  & \Big[ a^{\phi(n)}       = 1 \Big] \mod \ n \\
  & \Big[ a^{k\phi(n)}      = 1 \Big] \mod \ n \quad \Big| \cdot a \\
  & \Big[ a^{k \phi(n)+ 1}  = a \Big] \mod \ n \\
\end{align}
$$

The equation above tells us that for some integer number $k$ about which we don't really care and the number $n$ we can exponentiate the number $a$ with $k \phi(n)+1$ and under the $\text{mod} \ n$ regime we will obtain the same number $a$.
The cool thing that Euler's Theorem allows us to do is that we can obviously factorize, respectively construct, the exponent $k \phi(n)+1$ in any way we want.

And this is where we finally get to the main RSA algorithm.

### RSA Encryption

The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem leans heavily, and almost exclusively, on Euler's theorem to enable an asymmetric cryptographic system.
It starts out by taking a message, which are just numbers for computers, and exponentiating it with the secret key $e$ and applying the modulo operator $\text{mod} \ n $ to it to generate an encrypted cypher text $c$,

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Encryption}: \quad c = [ x^e ] \mod n.
\end{align}
$$

We can conclude that we only need the encryption key $e$ (which is a number) and the modulo basis $n$ (which is also just a number) to be public to enable anybody to encrypt a message for us.
The almost identical operation, albeit with the secret key $d$, is performed to decrypt the cypher message $c$,

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Decryption}: \quad x = [ c^d ] \mod n
\end{align}
$$

The big question is obviously whether there is a strict one-to-one correspondence between the encryption and the decryption.
To show this, we can again employ Euler's theorem to guarantee the need one-to-one correspondence, such that

$$
\begin{align}
[ c^d &= x ] \mod n \\
\Big[ \big( [ x^e ] \mod n \big)^d &= x \Big] \mod n \\
\Big[ \prod^d_i \big( [ x^e ] \mod n \big) &= x \Big] \mod n \quad \\
\Big[ \prod^d_i x^e &= x \Big] \mod n \quad \text{(Transitivity Rule)} \\
\Big[ \big( x^e \big)^d &= x \Big] \mod n \\
\Big[ x^{ed} &= x \Big] \mod n \\
\end{align}
$$

Thus if we are able to find a corresponding exponent in our encryption/decryption scheme that fulfills Euler's theorem, we have a wonderful asymmetric cryptographic system which checkmarks all the requirements we wanted.

$$
\begin{align}
\Big[ x^{ed} &= x \Big] \mod \ n \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \Big[ a^{k \phi(n)+ 1}  = a \Big] \mod \ n 
\end{align}
$$

The beauty of the modulo operator is that it's really hard to guess the correct $d$ since there are an infinite number of possible $d$'s due to the arbitrary $k$ for which the modulo operator returns a possible correct $x$.

In order to get the mathematical equivalency that the encryption and subsequent decryption under the modulo $n$ operation is valid, all we have to do is find a $d$ for which holds

$$
\begin{align}
e d &= k \phi(n)+1 \\
e d &= k \phi(pq)+1 \\
e d &= k \phi(p) \phi(q) + 1 \\
\Big[ ed &= 1 \Big] \mod \phi(p) \phi(q) \\
\end{align}
$$

which tells us that we are indeed generating the private key $d$ with the private ingredients of $\phi(p)$ and $\phi(q)$
of our two secret prime numbers $p$ and $q$.

The last thing to check is that $a$ and $n$ are indeed coprime which is happens with overwhelming probability.
