## Introduction

This is a talk I gave at the Berlin Machine Learning Meetup on Nov 6, 2017.
It is somewhat more high level than usual since the audience came from a broad range of backgrounds.

The content of the talk were 'AlphaGo', it's successor 'AlphaGo Zero' and 'Feudal Networks' all published by DeepMind.
The talk can be downloaded [here](BML-AdvRL.pdf)
